        <h2>Optifine Not Installed</h2>
        <p>
            There will be some message about "OptifineForgeTweaker" in your errors. This is because
            you don't have the <b>SPECIFIC</b> version of optifine installed.
            In the README.txt there is an optifine link. open it. download it, and double click the jar to run
            the installer. Then try reopening GandyClient.
        </p>
