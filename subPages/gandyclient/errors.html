        <h2>Optifine Not Installed</h2>
        <p>
            There will be some message about "OptifineForgeTweaker" in your errors. This is because
            you don't have the <b>SPECIFIC</b> version of optifine installed.
            In the README.txt there is an optifine link. open it. download it, and double click the jar to run
            the installer. Then try reopening GandyClient.

        <h2>Discord IPC Error (FIXED - please install the new version)</h2>
        You may crash because you do not have discord running on your desktop. This may be due to the fact that you are
        using
        discord on a web browser. This is a known bug and is currently being fixed. It may even be fixed already
        <br></br>
        <h2>A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:</h2>
        <p>
            You are using an integrated graphics card most likely made by intel. There are a few possible solutions
            but no 100% fix as this bug is still being observed.
        </p>
        <h3>FIX 1: Updating your graphics card drivers</h3>
        <p>
            This error can be caused by an outdated integrated graphics card driver.
            If you have an intel one, you can update yours at https://downloadcenter.intel.com/
        </p>
        <h3>FIX 2: Manually creating a dump file</h3>
        <p>Go to task manager and while GandyClient is running, right click on the Java process and click "Create Dump
            File"</p>
